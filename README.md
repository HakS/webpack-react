# Webpack and ReactJS test project

This project is to learn how to use Webpack and ReactJS, this is using Babel to transpile ES6, in the future I will set up this to be able to use in a production environment, also will separate this to work in a more modular architecture and will use SASS as my styles precompiler.

## Instalation

* `git clone git@github.com:HakS/webpack-react.git`
* `cd webpack-react`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

Note: this project still doesn't have any production version, so right now the only way to see how is looking the application is to do `npm start`
